# murrls

A simple paper marbling program inspired by [Daniel Shiffman's Coding Challenge #183](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7IGZTjC008).
One main reason to make this is because Dana finally woke up from her slumber
and decided to code something today xD

## Name origin

It is like marble + balls = marlls but that for whatever reason wasn't good
enough for Dana so she "meowified" it and that's how _murrls_ was decided.
